I. TOPIC SUMMARY AND RELATION TO SDG

  Our project, "A Web-based Booking System for Althea's Orchard Private Resort and Events Place," is a produced solution concerning the way how tourism and hospitality industries are changing and recognizes the innovative potential that digital technology can offer. Althea's Orchard is a resort and events place that aims to cope with industry obstacles. The project's main goal is to build an effective web-based booking system in addition to an appealing online presence via a well-designed website. This system will help to address the resort's current issues and set it up for future development. Realizing Althea's Orchard's full potential has been hampered by issues including limited online visibility, poor booking management, and unrealized digital marketing possibilities. The suggested remedy is to lessen these obstacles and provide the resort with the tools it needs to prosper in the digital age. Basically, the project includes creating an aesthetically pleasing and easily navigable website that functions as a single repository for all the information guests need to plan their stay, book event spaces, access services, and more. Moreover, the product of this project is expected to improve worker productivity, reduce mistakes, and streamline processes. The online presence of the resort will be further enhanced by the inclusion of virtual tours, visitor reviews, and an administrative panel.

  The created system catalyzes favorable economic and employment results, in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. The resulting operational efficiency is expected to lead to increased economic growth for the resort.The improved online presence and streamlined operations are anticipated to contribute to the economic viability of Althea's Orchard, fostering a positive impact on local employment and economic development in the tourism sector. The objective of SDG 8, which is to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, is directly impacted by the resort's economic growth that is being driven by an increased online presence and efficient operations.

II. TECHNOLOGY USE FOR THE PROJECT AND WAY OF SET UP

 Within our system, we structured the front end using HTML to organize the web document, and CSS played a crucial role in defining dimensions, color schemes, and stylistic elements for the user interface. Furthermore, JavaScript was specifically implemented in the navigation menu and login section, allowing users to verify the accuracy of their entered passwords.

 On the backend, JavaScript took on significant responsibilities, including computing the total booking fees, generating booking itineraries, and serving a central role in the admin section. Its contributions extended to creating the availability calendar and producing report charts. PHP facilitated the connection between the system and the database, utilizing fetch, get, and post methods to retrieve and showcase necessary information. Mysqli queries were instrumental for fundamental database operations, encompassing select, insert into adding, and updating.

 To monitor the ongoing progress of the system, we relied on Wampserver64 for localhost or local server access to PHPMyAdmin. Within this environment, we established the database and tables essential for storing user-inputted information.
